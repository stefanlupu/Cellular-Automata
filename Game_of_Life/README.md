# Conway's Game of Life

My implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in Lua using the Love2D framework.

### PLEASE NOTE: 
- you must have both Lua and Love2D installed on your system for this program to work
- Windows and Mac OS have not been tested on but should in theory work

### CONTROLS:
- `space` pause/unpause the game
- `r` populate the screen with a randomised arangement of cells 
- `c` clear the screen
- `esc` quit the application

In addition you can click on screen to change the state of a cell manually However, this can only be done when the game is paused!

### TO RUN:
1. change into the directory that contains the folder: Game_of_Life
2. run `love Game_of_Life` into your terminal
